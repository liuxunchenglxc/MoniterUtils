# MoniterUtils
Some Python scripts for monitoring DL tasks

## database_monitor_util.py
A Python script for monitoring database changes, but only for specific monitoring.

SQLAlchemy is 1.x version, if you want to use 2.x version, you may need to migrate this script.

Before running the script, you need to modify Line 119-122, Line 241, and ADD your own listener manually.
